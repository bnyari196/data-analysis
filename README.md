# Data Analysis Report using R:
## Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to perform data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualization, and correlation analysis using R. The analysis is presented in an R Notebook to ensure reproducibility and clarity.

Objectives:
  - Perform data exploration and understand key attributes.
  - Compute descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
  - Implement data cleaning by handling missing values.
  - Utilize data visualization techniques, including scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and density plots.
  - Analyze correlations between variables.
  - Demonstrate the use of R functions (e.g., sapply(), ggplot2, corrplot).
